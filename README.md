# Welcome to my second project - GAMES MANAGEMENT APP

Few words before I get to the specificsâ€¦ 

## Why it was made?
Idea for this app came to me from:
- my inner need to making notes and lists about everything what is interesting for me,
- interest in computer games,
- SQL Server database, which was created by me a few years ago thanks to the two points above.
As time went by using only SSMS to keep track of my games collection proved itself far from comfortable, so I decided to make GUI-based app, which will make my life easier. Luckily, I recently finished extensive book about PyQT.

## Details
As soon as the project is finished, I will provide proper readme file with all features.  Until then I will post brief description of added functionalities after every commit on the main branch. I will keep stable version on the main branch and develop rest of the planned features on different ones.

List of features which are usable after most recent commit:
- database structure,
- main app window and sub window with games list called in Edit->Games (for now you could open it once for every start of application, I need to look it up),
- window for adding a new game and editing an existing one with parameters: title, series, genre, category, rating, collection, difficulty levels.
At this moment you can input all needed data to the database using only this app. I believe it is pretty user friendly and obvious in use.

In this paragraph I will put every information about features that may look odd at the first look, and why I made it like that:
- Collection attribute: it is divided into two categories: collection and storage, first one is dedicated to platform on which you have a copy of a game, and second one is to bind that copy to for example external hard drive. I have few of them myself and in case of GOG copies itâ€™s hard to keep track sometimes when you want to have downloaded backup.
- Difficulty attribute: difficulty list needs to be filled from the easiest possible difficulty level in the game to the hardest one. Iâ€™ve implemented logic in which this order itâ€™s remembered. Letâ€™s assume that game have three difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard, youâ€™ve inserted this values in proper order and finished the level medium. When you mark it as completed also level easy will be marked as completed, because itâ€™s easier than medium. Iâ€™ve made it this way to never replay a game on the easier level than I completed â€“ so even my hobby is challenging ðŸ˜Š

Iâ€™m developing this on:
- Python 3.8
- PyQT 5.15.4
- MS SQL SERVER Management Studio 2014

## How can you run it?
To use this app in a desired manner you need:
1.	Download all the files.
2.	Install SQL Server which allows you create database from db_DatabaseStructure.sql file.
3.	Create stored procedure from db_GameDataManipulation.sql file.
4.	Connect app to a database: in order to do that you need to create another .py file called config.py. That file must contain below lines filled with your local server name assigned to a server variable.

```python
server = ''
db = 'GAMESTEMP'

conn_string = f'DRIVER={{SQL Server}};'\
                f'SERVER={server};'\
                f'DATABASE={db}'
```

5.	Run main.py.

There is a lot of work ahead of me, so enough talking! Have a great day!
